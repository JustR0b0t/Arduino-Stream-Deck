# Arduino-Stream-Deck
This is an experimental School Project, inspired by an Elgato Stream Deck

Its using 6 Buttons on the Arduino to send inputs to the computer disquised as a Keyboard. 
For additional functionality it used AutoHotKey.

Theres also an LED Strip or Stick added, because why not. And an Easter Egg too.

An Arduino with an ATMega32U4 is needed. This Project used an Arduino Leonardo.
